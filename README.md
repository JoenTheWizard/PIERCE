# The PIERCE project

The PIERCE project is a multi-functional pen-testing and cyber-security tool mainly for Windows (since it's made with WPF) I made ages ago. I am not working on it as much as of right now.

The PIERCE project has a lot of features included with it. Some of these features include:

- Tor Web browser (with an additional HTTP web proxy to intercept traffic)
- Network Sniffer
- Disassembler (x86 and x64), Hex Editor, and Memory Editor (not as efficient or fully-functional)
- SSH Client (only relies on stdout)
- Encoder and Encryptor / Decoder and Decryptor
- Bruteforcing (Subdomains, directories, HTTP Post queries etc.)
- And a lot more little content

The project in general could definitely be improved in a lot of other ways and could use some fixes here and there.
But I am not working on it as much anymore, so the room for improvement could never come or much later in the future.
