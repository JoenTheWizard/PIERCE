# The PIERCE project

The PIERCE project is a multi-functional pen-testing and cyber-security tool mainly for Windows (since it's made with WPF) I made ages ago. I am not working on it as much as of right now.

The PIERCE project has a lot of features included with it. Some of these features include:

- Tor Chromium-based Web browser (with an additional HTTP web proxy to intercept traffic)
- Network Sniffer
- Disassembler (x86 and x64), Hex Editor, and Memory Editor (not as efficient or fully-functional)
- SSH Client (only relies on stdout/stderr) with SFTP functionalities
- Encoder and Encryptor / Decoder and Decryptor
- Bruteforcing (Subdomains, directories, HTTP Post queries etc.)
- Includes Monaco (browser-based code editor with syntax highlighting)
- And a lot more little content

The project in general could definitely be improved in a lot of other ways and could use some fixes here and there.
But I am not working on it as much anymore, so the room for improvement could never come or much later in the future.
There might still be some debugging code within it as well.
